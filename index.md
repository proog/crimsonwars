  Do you remember *Crimson Wars*? Few people do these days.
</p>

<div markdown="1">
Crimson Wars is a 1999 RTS game that has largely been forgotten. Practically no official references to it exist online anymore, save for some [press releases](http://www.cbronline.com/news/icl_finally_launches_gamezone_european_online_game_service/) that mention it in passing. Some [gameplay videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLurynNbqIU6z3eKSxF3on8nGoz5zCptPK) do exist, but dig deeper than that and you'll find nothing of substance.

Is it a great game? Probably not. But I do have some nostalgia left for it, and I also have an unhealthy obsession with digging up old, obscure things.

<h1 class="display-4 text-center">Prologue</h1>
<p class="lead text-center">Chaos Control / Solar Crusade</p>

On March 3, 1972, the Pioneer 10 planetary exploration probe was launched into space with a message including the coordinates of Earth. In the year 2050, long after having left behind the limits of the solar system, Pioneer 10 was still continuing its long cosmic voyage when it suddenly and mysteriously was immobilized and stopped transmitting. On Earth, this silence was interpreted as a transmission failure. That was a fatal mistake: someone had intercepted the imprudent Earth message and was getting ready to make good use of it: the alien _Kesh Rhan_ race.

In the year 2071, the aggressive Kesh Rhan ravage human settlements within our solar system. Following devastating battles between the Orbital Defense Force and the Kesh Rhan, the human colonies on Mars and Pluto are completely wiped out. Lt. Jessica Darkhill, top pilot of the ODF, embarks on a heroic mission with her squadron to save Earth from the same fate.

First, a potent computer virus must be stopped dead in its tracks or it will set humanity back to the stone age. Using a special device, Darkhill's brain is connected directly to the alien computer and she is able to destroy the virus from inside the alien system. Next, Darkhill and her squadron manages to destroy the well-defended Kesh Rhan flagship and terminate its Lord Commander Arakh' Kreen. With the fall of the flagship, the rest of the Kesh Rhan fleet can be dealt with safely.

Soon enough, the war is over. The Kesh Rhan forces are obliterated. Earth has been freed from the alien menace. All is well within the Orbital Defense Force... or is it? Lt. Darkhill and company discover a derelict freighter while exploring the remains of the battle near Mars. Upon closer inspection they discover something they wish they never had... the Kesh Rhan are still alive, and they are not giving up without a fight.

<p class="lead text-center">In the beginning was CHAOS...</p>

One hundred sixty-six years have passed since the events described in Chaos Control and Solar Crusade. On Mars, the human colonists have cleared the desert for cultivation. Numerous oases have arisen out of the burning sands. Each Oasis, called a Territory, is, by origin, the property of the Mega-corporation which built it.

There are 6 Mega-corporations:

- The _Cyber Trek_ Mega-corporation
- The Merchants' Cartel (_Euro Carbonis_)
- The _Martian Mining Corporation_
- The _Oxyd Weapons_ Mega-corporation
- The _Terra-Prime_ Mega-corporation
- The _Ring Corporation_

The colonization was barely completed when 4 of the Mega-corporations banded together to secede from Earth (only Cyber Trek remained faithful to Earth, the Merchants' Cartel remained neutral). But the alliance of the 4 Mega-corporations lasted only as long as the victory on the mother planet. A bloody and brutal battle raged for several months. It is at that time that, in order to spare human lives, robotic and cybertech weapons began to be used more and more. When the Earth Federation recognized the Territories' independence in the hands of the 4 Mega-corporations, they resumed their old disputes and became independent states.

The vast territory of Olympia is the last enclave of Earth's empire on Mars. It is also a territory whose substratum abounds in extraordinary riches not yet exploited. Of all the Martian territories, it holds the most promise for the future. And, most importantly, this enclave was built around the Martian "Sphinx" in the valley of Cydonia. What are the "powers" of the Sphinx? Only the future will tell us...

Earth is trying to defend against the plans of the 4 Mega-corporations (who possess all the surrounding territories) to control Olympia. Taking advantage of the dissension between the Mega-corporations, Earth is managing to re-establish strong military bases on its last colony. As long as the terrestrials keep to themselves and pose no direct threat to them, the Mega-corporations leave them pretty much alone.

But a new element is about to disrupt this delicate balance: several Kesh Rhan fleets have arrived in the solar system. The Lord Commanders have stationed their respective fleets in geostationary orbit in our system. Contrary to their customary hostile rivalry, the Aliens of the different fleets are not attacking each other for now. But they are also not showing any desire to reunite...

There are 4 Kesh Rhan fleets, which are named after their Lord Commander:

- The _Siir-Kar√Æs_ fleet.
- The _Zaaer_ fleet.
- The _Karn-Zarion_ fleet.
- The _Kiiryn-Lyr_ fleet.

The Aliens' presence and attitude can be explained as follows:

- You may recall that the Kesh Rhan race was born out of genetic engineering and an accelerated evolutionary process. The Kesh Rhans have no knowledge of their original homeland, from which they were exiled. They wander around in space, searching for this lost world.
- Since the expedition of Lord Commander Arakh Kreen (Chaos Control), the techno-probes of the different Kesh Rhan fleets are concentrating on the solar system. According to the techno-probes, Mars may well be the native planet of the Kesh Rhans... Once the Kesh Rhans are certain that Mars is their original home, they will no doubt do everything in their power to reclaim the red planet, and one of the fleets will attempt to take control of it...
- Basically, even if the Kesh Rhans are a warrior race, they do not especially hate Humans (should they find that Mars is not their home planet, they would leave and resume their quest in space). It was only the fanatical paranoia of Lord Commander Arakh Kreen which led to the confrontation between the Kesh Rhans and the Humans in Chaos Control. Nevertheless, fear and mistrust continue to grow among the Humans.

A triangle of hate now prevails on Mars. Mistrust among the Terrestrials, the Kesh Rhans and the rival Mega-corporations is such that the most insane alliances are beginning to form. Each human faction (people from Earth or members of the Mega-corporations), is attempting to ally with one of the Kesh Rhan fleets. Embassies are secretly being sent from the different sides... It is in this way that the Kesh-Rhans finally gain control of several Martian Territories. They even create actual states and play an active role in the vast military-economic chessboard that the red planet has become.

A second event will bring about a surge in violence on Mars: up to now, Olympia has been held under the iron-fist of Governor Xicander. But his disappearance has plunged the planet into chaos. Was this a murder backed by the Mega-corporations? By the Kesh Rhans? Has he been kidnapped? Numerous theories are spread and a war of succession has left a blood-bath in the Territory of Olympia. Some provinces have gone so far as to reclaim their independence, even resorting to weapons. Automatic defense weapons have been stationed all over the place (in this way, if a province were to be abandoned, the weapons would continue to make life difficult for the invaders...).

Four powerful former colonies surround the Territory of Olympia geographically. Now that Xicander is gone, the rush for the spoils is on. Each faction wants its slice of the cake. The final objective of this intense victory campaign is control of the Capital of Olympia. All the forces present are aware of the real stake: Mars is 90% barren and efforts to entirely terraform the planet will be a disaster. The Sphinx is doubtless the key for which everyone is searching:

- According to the Kesh Rhans, the Sphinx holds the answer to their question (_is Mars their planet of origin?_).
- According to the Mega-corporations and the Terrestrials, it is no coincidence that the face of the Sphinx in the valley of Cydonia is an exact duplicate of the one from Kheops, which dates back to the time when Egypt was the most advanced civilization on Earth. The Sphinx may hold the key to the red planet's energy problems and would enable humans to colonize it perfectly. The Mega-corporation which held this key would no longer need to resort to the Merchants' Mega-corporation to solve all its logistical problems...
